### ✨ Usage

Once installed, run the command:

```bash
mangadex-dl
```

You’ll be prompted with two modes:

- **Solo** → Download by chapter ID.
- **Bulk** → Download by manga ID and select chapters from an interactive list.

The result will be `.zip` archives containing clean, ordered images of the manga chapter(s).

### ❓ Example

**Solo Mode** (Chapter ID):

```md
Enter Chapter ID: cd0dbfeb-3e6b-4f93-907c-8b2e71b41ae2
```

This will save the chapter as:

```md
chapter-1-en.zip
```

**Bulk Mode** (Manga ID):

```md
Enter Manga ID: 559c5fc6-6a57-43a6-93cb-b43328bc1957
```

Then select chapters interactively, e.g.:

```md
✔ Chapter 1 [English]
✔ Chapter 1 [Arabic]
✔ Chapter 2 [English]
```

Files will be saved like:

```md
chapter-1-en.zip
chapter-1-ar.zip
chapter-2-en.zip
```
